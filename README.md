# PROJECT_TM.js

PROJECT_TM.js is a javascript rewrite of https://github.com/williamztom/ProjectTM using React.js.

The purpose of this project is to give League of Legends tournament maker's an easier time when balancing teams for larger-scale tournaments with 10 or more people.

It is important to note that PROJECT_TM.js only works on RiotGames' NA1 servers.
